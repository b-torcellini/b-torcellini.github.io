                Benjamin Torcellini is a young organist based out of the Northeast Corner of Connecticut. As a very small child, Benjamin took piano lessons, starting at the age of 7, and violin lessons at the age of 8. In 2020, when he began attending the historical family church, he became interested in organ. The church had a historical 1884 George Hutchens organ consisting of 9 ranks. A few months later, in June of 2021, he began lessons at that church. While that only lasted a short time, he continued playing.

                Currently, he is taking lessons with Dr. Trisha Snyder of the Storrs Congregational Church, with whom he has studied since 2022. He is first bass on the Anglican Singers out of New London, CT, and studies violin with Martha Herle at the Community Music School. In his spare time, he studies theology and hymnology, thinks about organs, and, if that doesn’t fill everything, might do some rebuilding of melodeons. He is also a member of the American Guild of Organists and likes to pet cats.
