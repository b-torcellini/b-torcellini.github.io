                Benjamin Torcellini is a young organist based out of the Northeast Corner of Connecticut. As a very small child, Benjamin took piano lessons, starting at the age of 7, and violin lessons at the age of 8. In 2020, when he began attending the historical family church,  the Congregational Church of Eastford, he became interested in organ. The church had a historical 1884 George Hutchens organ consisting of 9 ranks. A few months later, in June of 2021, he began lessons at that church.

In his spare time, he studies theology and hymnology, thinks about organs, or works on one of his two reed organs.
